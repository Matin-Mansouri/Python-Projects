# Contact Book

This project is a simple Contact Book application that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. It is implemented in Python and runs in the terminal.

## Project Implementation

The primary data structure was a built-in Python dictionary, which was tasked with managing contact entries. This structure was chosen due to its efficiency in handling these particular operations (O(1) average complexity for add, delete, get operations).

## Features

- View all contacts.
- Edit an existing contact.
- Delete a contact.

## Installation

## Usage
